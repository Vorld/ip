It is interesting to see how Claude Code could help with the process even if I never allow it to directly
code in my project. My approach is mostly to treat it like a senior architect/developer and asking questions about
design decisions (e.g. "Right now parsing of DateTimes throughout my project are all spread across classes, what are some
ways I can design my program better to avoid this?"). Other than this, I also find Claude Code useful to generate Test stubs.
